🎧 Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent

A conversational AI agent that helps users design, debug, and optimize audio circuits such as preamplifiers, filters, and op-amp-based amplifiers. The assistant provides suggestions to reduce noise, minimize distortion, and improve overall circuit performance.

 📌 Problem Statement

Audio circuits are sensitive and often encounter issues like unwanted noise, signal distortion, or incorrect gain. Beginners and even experienced designers struggle to find quick solutions to these problems. This project addresses the need for an interactive agent that can assist users by answering natural-language queries about audio circuit design and troubleshooting.

 ✅ Features

- Understands user queries like:
  - "Why is my op-amp amplifier noisy?"
  - "How do I reduce distortion?"
  - "What filter should I use for bass?"
- Recommends:
  - Filter designs
  - Op-amp configurations
  - Grounding and layout tips
- Intent classification using NLU
- Can be deployed on web, WhatsApp, or SMS via Twilio

 🚀 Technologies Used

- IBM Watsonx Assistant – For conversational AI  
- Twilio API – For message-based interaction (WhatsApp/SMS)  

🛠️ System Architecture

Optional: Backend Python Logic

⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-assistant-agent.git
cd audio-assistant-agent
````

 2. Configure IBM Watson Assistant

* Create an IBM Cloud account
* Setup Watsonx Assistant and define:
