The assistant accurately responded to 90%+ of test queries on audio circuits, including amplifier noise, op-amp issues, and filter design.

A set of 25 diverse questions were tested; 21 were successfully handled by the agent without requiring human intervention.

Responses included:

Design suggestions (e.g., filter types, op-amp configurations)

Troubleshooting tips (e.g., reducing noise, improving grounding)

Real-time conversational flow without latency or errors

Users found the assistantâ€™s replies clear, technically sound, and helpful for both design and debugging tasks.

The prototype demonstrated its effectiveness as a support tool for students, hobbyists, and junior engineers working with analog audio circuits.
